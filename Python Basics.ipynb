It is popular for its simplicity and versatility.\n","Here are some reason why it is popular:-\n","1. Easy to learn\n","2. Versatile in nature\n","3. Have lots of library\n","4. Compatibility\n","\n","#Ques2 : What is an interpreter in Python?\n","\n","Ans 2 : Interpreter is a software used to excute the python code.an interpreter helps to translate the command that you have write into computer understandable lanaguage.\n","\n","#Ques3: What are pre-defined keywords in Python?\n","\n","Ans 3: In python there are set of code that are pre-define with their functions.\n","Some pre-defined keyword are:\n","\n","if\n","\n","else\n","\n","break\n","\n","continue\n","\n","for\n","\n","while\n","\n","#Ques4: Can keywords be used as variable names?\n","\n","Ans 4: NO keyword can't used as variable names, because keyword have a pre-defined functions for writing code with logics.\n","\n","#Ques5: What is mutability in Python?\n","\n","Ans 5 : In python the mutability refers to the ability to modify and change the value after it is created.\n","\n","#Ques6: Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable?\n","\n","Ans : In lists their are no set of rules which means we can change their values without changing their identities. While, In tuples there is different thing If you will try to change their values then identity will get affected.\n","\n","#Ques7 : What is the difference between “==” and “is” operators in Python?\n","\n","Ans : The “==” operator is used to compare the value of the variable.The “is” operator is use to compare the memory locations of two objects. It returns True if the two objects have the same location , and False otherwise.\n","\n","#Ques8: What are logical operators in Python?\n","\n","Ans : Logical operator are used to combine the multiple conditions and evaluate them in a same bolean expression.\n","\n","#Ques9 :  What is type casting in Python?\n","\n","Ans : Type casting is a process used to change the data type of value or object. It correct the mismatch in data type of value or object.\n","\n","#Ques10: What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting?\n","\n","Ans: Implicit type conversion is performed by a Python interpreter only. While, Explicit type conversion is performed by the user by explicitly using type conversion functions in the program code.It is also known as typecasting.\n","\n","#Ques11 :  What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python?\n","Ans: In python, the conditional statements are used to control the flow of execution based on whether the certain contion is true or false.\n","\n","Example:-\n","          \n","          age = 18\n","\n","          if age >= 18:\n","              print(\"you can drive a car\")\n","          else:\n","              print(\"you can't drive a car\")\n","\n","\n","#Ques12 : How does the elif statement work?\n","\n","Ans: In conditional statements the elif word stands for “else if” , it is use to check multiple condition. Like , if the first condition is false, it moves on to the next “elif” statement to check if that condition is true.\n","\n","example:-\n","\n","        age = int(input(\"Enter your age\");\n","        \n","        if age >= 18:\n","          print(\" You can drive a  car\")\n","        elif age == 18:\n","          print(\"you can drive a car\")\n","        else:\n","          print(\"you can't drive a car\")\n","\n","#Ques13 : What is the difference between for and while loops?\n","Ans: A “for” loop is used for iterating over a sequence. While , with the while loop we can execute a set of statements as long as a condition is true.\n","\n","#Ques14 : Describe a scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop?\n","Ans: Use of \"for\" loop when you know the loop will be executed for short or 'n' no times. Use of \"while\" loop for reading a file which are mentioned in a variable. Use a while loop when asking for user input.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"rkghNGNl5s-D"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["#Python Basics Practical Question\n"],"metadata":{"id":"t9qa06gpLoJB"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Practical Question\n","'''\n","1.
